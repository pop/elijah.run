        <content type="html" xml:base="/kubernetes-as-an-external-service-proxy/">&lt;p&gt;Say you have a firewall restriction that creates the following situation:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App1 cannot communicate directly with App2.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App1 and App2 can both talk to a Kubernets cluster.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither app is hosted on the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you get messages between App1 and App2?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the problem is stated makes it pretty obvious that the solution &lt;em&gt;involves&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; using a Kubernetes cluster, but how exactly?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naive solution might be to spin up a container which acts as a proxy; Nginx comes to mind.
This would definitely work, but I am exceedingly lazy and don&#x27;t want to learn how to configure Nginx.
In fact, the solution I came to doesn&#x27;t involve running any new pods!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s the code.
Below I&#x27;ll explain what&#x27;s happening here and why it works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;endpoints&quot;&gt;Endpoints&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are the Kubernetes abstraction for IPs+Ports running the same application.
It&#x27;s how you group together N instances of an app into one pool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood Endpoints get created as a pre-requisite for every Service you deploy.
You don&#x27;t usually need to deal with these directly as they are created implicitly whenever a Deployment gets applied.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By manually creating an endpoint we have imported our non-kubernetes app into Kubernetes.
That means we can do Kubernetes things with it like expose it via a Service or even put it behind an Ingress Pretty neat!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;service&quot;&gt;Service&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services are how we expose an endpoint to the world.
Most cloud providers will give you a public IP address for a service and load balance across all of that service&#x27;s endpoints.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is as far as we need to proxy traffic between our two Apps.
App1 makes a request to whatever IP Kubernetes gets for the &lt;code&gt;myapp-proxy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; Service and relays it to the &lt;code&gt;myapp-proxy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; endpoint, which ultimately routes the traffic to App2.
What&#x27;s really cool is that the endpoint that &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; App2 can be an self-hosted Virtual Machine, as long as the IP doesn&#x27;t change this proxy will continue to work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingress&quot;&gt;Ingress&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingresses are my favorite part of Kubernetes.
They&#x27;re very convenient, incredibly powerful, and they work like... over half the time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not strictly necessary, this Ingress gives us some nice-to-haves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives us an easy to manage host name via something like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes-incubator&#x2F;external-dns&quot;&gt;External DNS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could be extended to terminate SSL, again &quot;for free&quot;, with something like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jetstack&#x2F;cert-manager&quot;&gt;Cert Manager&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#x27;s how we use Kubernetes to manage services (lower-case &#x27;s&#x27;) which aren&#x27;t running in Pods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="/chef-dynamic-attributes/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are trying to set a node attribute in a resource block but it isn&#x27;t working.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you have the following code:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;&quot; class=&quot;language-ruby &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ruby_block &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fbe3bf;&quot;&gt;foo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  block &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6d6d6d;&quot;&gt;# some ruby
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    node.override[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fbe3bf;&quot;&gt;var&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;] &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fbe3bf;&quot;&gt;value&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  action &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fdb082;&quot;&gt;:run
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;if&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; node[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fbe3bf;&quot;&gt;var&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;] &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;== &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fbe3bf;&quot;&gt;value&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  notifies &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fdb082;&quot;&gt;:run&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, some_resource[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6699cc;&quot;&gt;name&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;else
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  notifies &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fdb082;&quot;&gt;:run&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, other_resource[whatever]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff5e5e;&quot;&gt;end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you&#x27;re setting &lt;code&gt;node[&#x27;var&#x27;]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;other_resource[whatever]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is getting notified to &lt;code&gt;:run&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.
What gives?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To jump ahead, because you&#x27;re skimming this post for the answer, you&#x27;re going to want to do something like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;diff&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;&quot; class=&quot;language-diff &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-diff&quot; data-lang=&quot;diff&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;# go-go-gadget diffs
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;# Chef Version 13.5.8
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ruby_block &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39; do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    block do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      # some ruby
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      node.override[&amp;#39;var&amp;#39;] = &amp;#39;value&amp;#39;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f92672;&quot;&gt;-   action :run
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a6e22e;&quot;&gt;+   action :nothing
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f92672;&quot;&gt;- end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a6e22e;&quot;&gt;+ end.run_action(:run)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;if node[&amp;#39;var&amp;#39;] == &amp;#39;value&amp;#39;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  notifies :run, some_resource[name]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;else
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  notifies :run, other_resource[whatever]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically you want to execute the &lt;code&gt;ruby_block&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that sets your attribute &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; so the rest of your code can consume the value either later in the compilation phase or during the execution phase of the Chef run.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-why-did-that-work&quot;&gt;How&#x2F;why did that work?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;ve read his far you&#x27;re actually reading.
Welcome to the post!
Let&#x27;s begin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s dig into &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; what my problem was, because sometimes examples aren&#x27;t good enough.
You know... for fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to trigger an application upgrade based on the current installed version.
I was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; installing a package-manager-managed package&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; so I couldn&#x27;t just pin the version a &lt;code&gt;yum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; resource, I had to do this kludge of a solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me &lt;code&gt;some_resource[name]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; was downloading the latest version of the app (a &lt;code&gt;.tar.gz2&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file from GitHub) and &lt;code&gt;other_resource[whatever]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; was a no-op. The as part of the package download I unconditionally trigger a &lt;code&gt;:delayed&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; service restart.
Chef was &#x27;upgrading&#x27; and restarting my app every thirty minutes which broke core functionality.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shit-i-tried-before-stumbling-upon-the-solution&quot;&gt;Shit I tried before stumbling upon the solution&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a bunch of things, but they can all kinda be summed up in this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;diff&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;&quot; class=&quot;language-diff &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-diff&quot; data-lang=&quot;diff&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;# yay more diffs
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ruby_block &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39; do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    block do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      # some ruby
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      node.override[&amp;#39;var&amp;#39;] = &amp;#39;value&amp;#39;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    notifies :create, &amp;#39;tar[my-app]&amp;#39;, :immediately # Triggers tar[my-app] to run now
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f92672;&quot;&gt;- if node[&amp;#39;var&amp;#39;] == &amp;#39;value&amp;#39;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f92672;&quot;&gt;-   notify :run, some_resource[name]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f92672;&quot;&gt;- else
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f92672;&quot;&gt;-   notify :run, other_resource[whatever]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f92672;&quot;&gt;- end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  tar &amp;#39;my-app&amp;#39; do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    action  :nothing # Unless triggered this does nothing
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a6e22e;&quot;&gt;+   only_if { node[&amp;#39;var&amp;#39;] == &amp;#39;value&amp;#39; } # This should also do nothing if this isn&amp;#39;t true
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    # The rest of the resource block
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  end
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which ultimately didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I... I have no idea why this didn&#x27;t work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something something Chef is complicated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-solution-works-and-the-other-stuff-didn-t&quot;&gt;Why the solution works (and the other stuff didn&#x27;t)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason my ultimate solution &lt;em&gt;did&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; work is best summed up by this quote from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.chef.io&#x2F;resource_common.html#run-action&quot;&gt;Chef Docs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;.run_action(:some_action)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; at the end of a resource block to run
the specified action during the compile phase.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original code (read: broken code) was running the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; block during the compilation phase (happens earlier) and running the &lt;code&gt;ruby_block&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in the execution phase (happens later).
By telling it to run my &lt;code&gt;ruby_block&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; during the compilation phase we were ensuring it happened before the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; block, and in a way running it like you would &#x27;expect&#x27; a script to run.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ain&#x27;t idiomatic but it gets the job done.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;errata&quot;&gt;Errata&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say that three times fast.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service was in question was Prometheus.
When Chef ran every 30 minutes, it killed the Prometheus process and thus killed all of our pending alerts.
TLDR we didn&#x27;t get any alerts that took more than 30 minutes to trigger We also &lt;em&gt;kept&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; getting alerts that should taken a few hours to re-notify.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>/graduation/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="/graduation/">&lt;p&gt;Today I checked my grades for the last time.
I can safely say that I have &lt;strong&gt;finally&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; gotten a gorramn undergraduate degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics, from Oregon State University.[^1]&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear that this happens on the reg&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; but I&#x27;m sure that every single person who &lt;em&gt;actually graduates&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; feels amazing when they do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s not amazing because graduation is a Herculean feat.
I know I&#x27;m not a 60 year old grandmother who dreamt of getting a college degree for 45 years and finally scraped together the cash and time in retirement.
I&#x27;m also not a refugee that escaped a war-torn country for an education and a better life.
I&#x27;m just another white dude that checked all the boxes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#x27;t hard for me. I just had to put my head down and do the work.
But it did take a long ass time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly my story is exactly like &lt;em&gt;most&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; college graduation stories.
I went to kindergarten, then elementary school, then middle school, then high school, then college, and now life.
I plugged away at school, did what I needed to pass my classes, stressed and lamented, studied hard and eventually the system said &quot;Cool.You&#x27;re done.&quot; Along the way I learned how to &quot;play the game&quot;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, albeit a bit late compared to a lot of my peers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m thankful to be in a field which doesn&#x27;t require a masters or PHD to get a jorb.
Heck my field doesn&#x27;t really require the degree I got; a surprising number of my friends got well paying jobs sans-degree.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m also thankful to graduate without debt.
This came from some kickass parents + grandparents, some work during school, and some bad stuff that happened which ended up paying for abou half of my tuition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m thankful to graduate with wonderful friends, a job, and some passions which make my work-related decisions simple and profitable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, I&#x27;m thankful to be &lt;em&gt;done&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Now I can finally focus on &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, my real passion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m gonna have a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;10barrel.com&#x2F;beer&#x2F;crush-cucumber-sour&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Cucumber Sour&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and celebrate.
Thanks for reading.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t claim to have the best sources, but at least it&#x27;s not Yahoo Answers: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reference.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;many-people-graduate-college-year-8b0ccf821050d39e&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reference.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;many-people-graduate-college-year-8b0ccf821050d39e&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go beavs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m 99% sure I graduated.
Something horribly kafkaesque might still happen, but fuckit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is shorthand for tips and tricks to get through school.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School isn&#x27;t really focused on making sure you &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, it&#x27;s mostly designed to make sure you can pass tests.
Once you figure this out you can focus on learning for the test instead of trying to grok the material.
I believe the kids call it a &quot;life hack&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that you shouldn&#x27;t try to grok the material, that just happens to take &lt;em&gt;way&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; longer than test-based learning.
So if you want a personal life, learn for the test; if you want a PHD, learn for the material.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t figure this system out until about Junior year of High School, too late to apply this zen skill to the ACT and SAT, but it was useful in college.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A baroness looks at the Mona Lisa and sees her newborn baby in the background.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MagicRealismBot&#x2F;status&#x2F;768207599468634113&quot;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Wangle (of the prestigious Canadian Royalty) flew to the Louvre for her 27th birthday.
In past visits she had always marveled at the beautiful marble statutes, historic illustrations, and the grandiose building itself.
She always loved the glass pyramid, even if she didn&#x27;t really see how it fit with the rest of the architecture.
The Louvre was a special place in her heart.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wanted to bring her newborn daughter &lt;em&gt;Anna&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; with but her husband &lt;em&gt;Harold&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was concerned about the baby flying only two months after being born.
L.W. offered to cancel the trip but he insisted that she go saying &lt;em&gt;&quot;Sweetie, you&#x27;ve been taking care of this baby for nine months. You can take a week off.
You deserve it.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; L.W. wasn&#x27;t one to fight over things like this so she packed for a three-day trip and went off to Paris.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an early riser, or perhaps just a jet-lagged riser -- she always wanted to be an early riser but it wasn&#x27;t in her genes.
Regardless, she was up early.
She didn&#x27;t like the dark of mid January mornings, but that animosity was more or less evened out by her love of being alone in the quiet frigid winter air.
She saw that the museum wouldn&#x27;t open for another two hours and so she adventured toward the big Ferris Wheel East of the museum.
She ultimately intended to walk by the riverfront but settled for seeing some sights first. She hadn&#x27;t been to Paris in many years and was curious to see how it had changed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To her disappointment nothing had really changed in Paris.
She supposed that was part of the charm; it was tastefully timeless.
One could come back year after year and get the same Paris they&#x27;d gotten before.
Friends could visit separately and talk about some hole-in-the-wall cafe they&#x27;d found independent of one-another.
Any city built on a certain level of tourism &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to keep the high-lights stable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum opened and a small line had started to form.
She got in line and held idle chit-chat with a couple from Dallas, Texas.
Their names were Jeffery and Matilda Almond.
They were eager to share that this was their way of celebrating their 30th Anniversary with &lt;em&gt;&#x27;the honeymoon they never had&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
L.W. asked who was partial to seeing the Louvre to which Jeff proudly exclaimed &lt;em&gt;&quot;It was all Matilda.
She got a degree in ART ya&#x27; know -- she&#x27;s real smart.
Most of this stuff goes way over my head but she&#x27;s there to explain it to me.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Matilda blushed, she was the quiet one and Jeff was the loud one of the pair, but she could tell they got along anyway.
L.W. smiled at this and with that the conversation awkwardly petered out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.W. always made a bee-line for the Mona Lisa when she went to the Louvre.
She made the mistake of meandering there on one of her trips but by the time she got to it it was too crowded (&lt;em&gt;only two hours after opening!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) to see it. She raced all of the Asian tourist families with their massive &lt;em&gt;Canon DSLR&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; cameras and was one of the first pairs of eyes to see it that day. She took it all in, noting yet again how much smaller it looks in real-life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wave after wave she took the piece in.
She knew there were better paintings in the Louvre but something resonated with her about the &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Something was special, some connection... was that... was that Anna in the background?
L.W. peered at the piece and realized that an exact replication of her daughter --&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m sorry reader.
I can&#x27;t do it.
I built this up too much and now... now the ... I&#x27;m not even sure what to call it.
The punchline?
It doesn&#x27;t make any sense.
I know the point of the MagicRealismBot stories isn&#x27;t to make something that &lt;em&gt;makes sense&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in a logical sense, but like... it should at least be &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and actions should be justified.
I&#x27;m not trying to write an &lt;strong&gt;&#x27;and then&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; story I&#x27;m trying to write a &lt;strong&gt;&#x27;therefore, and so&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize.
This was just a bad story to begin with.
I avoided the prompt for the majority of it anyway.
I even ignored that I had started this for almost three weeks, hoping I&#x27;d come back and the story would magically &lt;em&gt;become better&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
I know that&#x27;s not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a bad thing, but in this case it wasn&#x27;t a good sign -- delaying the inevitable usually means one is dread it.
That is kind of a necessity with these, take what you like from a prompt and push the rest to the side, barely quantifying the thing as &#x27;written from the prompt&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m rambling now.
Thank you for reading, it means a lot.
I&#x27;ll try to do something more -- I don&#x27;t know -- &lt;strong&gt;more better&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By looking at a fireplace, a medieval sorcerer can turn stone into
moonstones.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MagicRealismBot&#x2F;status&#x2F;766606956295356420&quot;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellyn scrambled to take notes as fast as she could.
She had finally found a way to produce &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and it would change &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;!
With &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; one could turn sand into gold, the living into the dead, and countless other &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; properties she had read of.
Now that she was able to produce that which had alluded sorcerers since the dawn of knowledge the sky was the limit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took her quill and parchment and wrote furiously.
She described in great detail the position of the Sun in the Sky, the time of year, where she stood in the room and where the room stood on Earth.
She knew every detail wouldn&#x27;t be important but every detail &lt;em&gt;could&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be so they all must be recorded.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing my robes, staring intently at 12 BoilingRocks in the fireplace, facing head-first at the display.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun stands high in a Summer&#x27;s fore-noon, just glancing through the window unto the fireplace.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duration of approximately three Hail Mary&#x27;s the stones turned white and fragile.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rocks no-doubt turned into &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; as was theorized.
Their shape and texture proves it so.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MoonStones glow faint white, matte and with hints of spiritual aura.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; weigh substantially less than the BoilingRocks did, perhaps losing mass in the process of transformation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she finished writing her findings she grabbed her wax and seal and marked it to be delivered to her mentor Rowan.
He had spent the better part of his long life (&lt;em&gt;76 years young!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) attempting to find the secret to producing &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; from earthly materials but had come up empty-handed.
Ellyn felt proud of her findings and was glad to be able to share it with Rowan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later Ellyn sent off her findings with a sample of the &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; via the local carrier.
She told him to &lt;em&gt;take it with haste to Rowan&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and gave the carrier an extra copper piece in hopes that he would.
The carrier ran off down the road, the journey was almost a quarter day&#x27;s travel so Ellyn returned to her study.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she sat in wait studying the &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, she grew weary of her findings.
Just a moment ago she was so sure of her discovery, but now that she had sent off the finding she became... hesitant.
Was this &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; or perhaps the similar &lt;em&gt;SilverStone&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was only theoretical, studied in the mind and never before in the hand; it had never been proven to exist so what made her so sure that &lt;em&gt;this rock&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was what they had been searching for.
She was, after all, just an apprentice sorcerer; what did she know?
If Rowan determined her findings untrue what would stop him from revoking his mentor ship?
Her years of study would be for naut.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellyn had always been prone to worry.
She took a deep breath and with nothing else to do, she sat in wait.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking at a fireplace, a medieval sorcerer can turn stone into
moonstones.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MagicRealismBot&#x2F;status&#x2F;766606956295356420&quot;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellyn scrambled to take notes as fast as she could.
She had finally found a way to produce &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and it would change &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;!
With &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; one could turn sand into gold, the living into the dead, and countless other &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; properties she had read of.
Now that she was able to produce that which had alluded sorcerers since the dawn of knowledge the sky was the limit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took her quill and parchment and wrote furiously.
She described in great detail the position of the Sun in the Sky, the time of year, where she stood in the room and where the room stood on Earth.
She knew every detail wouldn&#x27;t be important but every detail &lt;em&gt;could&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be so they all must be recorded.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing my robes, staring intently at 12 BoilingRocks in the fireplace, facing head-first at the display.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun stands high in a Summer&#x27;s fore-noon, just glancing through the window unto the fireplace.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duration of approximately three Hail Mary&#x27;s the stones turned white and fragile.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rocks no-doubt turned into &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; as was theorized.
Their shape and texture proves it so.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MoonStones glow faint white, matte and with hints of spiritual aura.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; weigh substantially less than the BoilingRocks did, perhaps losing mass in the process of transformation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she finished writing her findings she grabbed her wax and seal and marked it to be delivered to her mentor Rowan.
He had spent the better part of his long life (&lt;em&gt;76 years young!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) attempting to find the secret to producing &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; from earthly materials but had come up empty-handed.
Ellyn felt proud of her findings and was glad to be able to share it with Rowan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later Ellyn sent off her findings with a sample of the &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; via the local carrier.
She told him to &lt;em&gt;take it with haste to Rowan&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and gave the carrier an extra copper piece in hopes that he would.
The carrier ran off down the road, the journey was almost a quarter day&#x27;s travel so Ellyn returned to her study.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she sat in wait studying the &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, she grew weary of her findings.
Just a moment ago she was so sure of her discovery, but now that she had sent off the finding she became... hesitant.
Was this &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; or perhaps the similar &lt;em&gt;SilverStone&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was only theoretical, studied in the mind and never before in the hand; it had never been proven to exist so what made her so sure that &lt;em&gt;this rock&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was what they had been searching for.
She was, after all, just an apprentice sorcerer; what did she know?
If Rowan determined her findings untrue what would stop him from revoking his mentor ship?
Her years of study would be for naut.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellyn had always been prone to worry.
She took a deep breath and with nothing else to do, she sat in wait.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ghoul and an archbishop are fighting over custody of their children.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MagicRealismBot&#x2F;status&#x2F;749301833881915392&quot;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like every Friday night, Debra picked up her two daughters from her ex-wife&#x27;s house in Evanston and drove them downtown for the weekend.
As she drove away in her red 2008 Corolla with them she got a text message from her ex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From: Gwendolyn&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debra,&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please bring Lilyan and Odell back by 9pm on Sunday.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;They have school Monday morning.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra became immediately filled with rage.
&lt;em&gt;&#x27;Of course they both have school Monday morning!
I&#x27;m not stupid!
I&#x27;ve been doing this for four and a half years goddammit.
How stupid does she think I am?
Christ she can be such a --&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
and before she went down that rabbit hole she remembered what her therapist said.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just breath. Everything is going to be okay.
This is just temporary.
Her bitchy behavior only affects you if you let it.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra drove a few more miles, her daughters in the back staying cautiously silent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually Lilyan spoke up.
&quot;Debora, why does mommy so mean to you?&quot; deliberately calling Debra (or &lt;strong&gt;Debora&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; in Lilyan&#x27;s case) by her name and Gwen by &lt;em&gt;&#x27;mommy&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
This used to bug Debra but she eventually became apathetic toward the situation.
Gwendolyn had brainwashed the kids; she was honestly just glad she was able to fight and keep her daughters on the weekends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; mommy so mean to me. And sweety, I&#x27;m a ghoul and that means that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; people don&#x27;t really like me.&quot; Debra said matter-of-factly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Like racism?&quot; Lilyan asked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Exactly like racism Lily.And your mother is a Christian official called an &#x27;Archbishop&#x27;.
For some reason, probably some squabble hundreds of years ago [or maybe they&#x27;ve just always been biggots] none of your mother&#x27;s bosses liked that she was in a relationship me so she had to give it up.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a momentary pause as the girls thought this over.
Lilyan was six and Odell was eight, neither of which were really prepared to fully process what she was saying, but she wanted them to feel respected and independent so she participated in their questions.
They were both technically Gwendolyn&#x27;s daughters with a donor, Debra would have had child if she was able to but ghouls had a notorously difficult time doing anything related to &lt;em&gt;living&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, creating life included.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But why does she not like you?&quot; Lilyan finally asked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra sighed.
&quot;Well, I think she doesn&#x27;t like me because she wishes we could still be together.
We had a very romantic fling in the beginning and we really thought we could stay together but... well it wasn&#x27;t meant to last.
She just thinks that this is the best way to deal with the situation.
Some people would rather feel angry than sad.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilyan quickly followed up with the obvious &quot;Do you feel sad Debora?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra thought for a moment.
Lilyan asked again &quot;Do you feel sad Debora?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sometimes sweetie.
Sometimes I feel very sad and it makes it very hard to do things like go to work and eat food.
Most of the time that happens I remind myself how lucky I am to have you two to look forward to.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilyan didn&#x27;t know what else to ask and so the three sat in silence as they drove down Lake-Shore Drive.
The lamp posts cast yellow-tinged shadows on their faces as they each looked out the windows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odell finally spoke up, &quot;What are we going to do this weekend?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good question.
What do you guys want to do? I was thinking we could go mini-golfing once you get your homework done.
How does that sound?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both groaned.
Debra smiled &quot;Well I guess it&#x27;s settled. Mini putt-putt tomorrow afternoon.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="/emperor-stan-of-stantinople/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;prompt&quot;&gt;Prompt&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An emperor owns a steam-powered device which allows him to destroy the
past.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MagicRealismBot&#x2F;status&#x2F;749120629308203009&quot;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor Stan of Stantinople, the most prosperous 1500 square feet in all of &lt;strong&gt;Oak Burch Sunrise Shire&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Suburban [Gated] Community&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, ruled with an &lt;em&gt;iron fist&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and an endless stream of &lt;em&gt;Puns&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
His wife and three daughters obeyed his every whim, when it fit their schedules... and if they were in a good mood... and they wanted to.
Stan was content with his life as an emperor and ruler of his domain, no matter how far and wide that domain spanned.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Tuesday afternoon, as he stood at the edge of the sidewalk squinting toward his back yard and telling himself that &lt;em&gt;&#x27;Stantinople stretches as far as the eye can see&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, his mind drifted to the life he could have had.
He thought about all of the mistakes he had made like when he tried stand-up and totally bombed, when he got into massive debt from college and dropped out, and when he bought a house in the suburbs -- the mistakes!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemingly out of nowhere he was tapped on the nose by a delivery woman.
She told him to sign her PDA and before he could process what was happening she dropped a thick wooden, about the size of a bedside table, at his doorstep.
He turned around and the woman sped away in an un-marked FedEx van; it didn&#x27;t say FedEx, because it was unmarked, but the color and shape was right so Stan figured it probably was FedEx.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lugged the box into the house and down to the finished basement he (and a poster in the stairwell leading down to the basement) called the &lt;strong&gt;&#x27;Stantinople Man Cave&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, despite it not having many &lt;em&gt;Man Cave&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; amenities nor being an actual cave for which one might find men.
The entirety of the basement consisted of three dark brown leather couches lined up in an &#x27;L&#x27; formation in the corner and a small, almost child-sized foosball table on the opposite end of the room.
He didn&#x27;t even invest in a wide-screen TV and a few Lay-Z boy chairs with built-in mini-fridges! Stan really had no concept of what a &lt;em&gt;Man Cave&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ought to have but nobody really called him on it since he was obviously trying his sad 43 year-old best.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fumbled the box with a &lt;em&gt;WHOOMP&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; onto the carpet and painlessly opened it with its &lt;em&gt;No Hassle™ packaging&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, an innovation he did not realized had made its way to wooden packaging.
Removing the item Stan thought this new device was a sewing machine and he got excited, but upon closer inspection he realised it was not a sewing machine.
The device was a rectangular cube with rounded edges and was hollow in the middle except for what looked like some pistons; the device was matt black and had four rubber feet on the bottom and was branded &lt;em&gt;&#x27;Past Scrubber&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
He lifted the device out of the box and flipped &#x27;on&#x27; the devices only switch; it began to &lt;em&gt;whurrrrrr&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like a small engine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan rummaged through the box and found a piece of paper which read:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May this device only be used by the mightiest and wisest emperors.
With its mechanical power it may erase both mistakes and triumphs of
the past. It does not discriminate, this is the job of its master.
You are its master.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sweet! This thing looks cool.&quot; Stan said oblivious to the ominous tone of this note.
&quot;Let&#x27;s see... it can change the past.
I wonder what I should change...&quot; he said foolishly not taking this very serious device seriously.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well first I&#x27;d wish I&#x27;d never moved out to the suburbs.
That was a huge mistake.&quot;
The machine&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;whurrr&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;ing intensified and an instant later he found himself living in a nice apartment near down-town.
Since time had been altered, and in this universe you don&#x27;t remember old timeliness if you change the past (deal with it), Stan had no idea that anything had changed and had yet to make his first decision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well first I&#x27;d wish I never went to college, that was a huge waste of time just to drop out.&quot; and again (for you, not for him) the machine &lt;em&gt;whurrr&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;d louder and an instant later Stan found himself in a much shittier apartment, further from downtown.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well first I&#x27;d wish I went to college, I really could have done something with my life.&quot; and the machine didn&#x27;t respond because, despite it&#x27;s visual similarities to a sewing machine, the device only knew how to destroy time and not how to create it.
He would have known this if he read the freaking manual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan quickly grew bored with the device after naming off a few things he &lt;em&gt;wished&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; he had done and it just &lt;em&gt;whurr&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;ing on.
He switched the machine &lt;em&gt;off&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and put it in the corner and muttered to himself &quot;Maybe I can get something for it on ebay.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a furious bidding war between two hobbyist mechanics Stan got
$153 for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not bad.&quot; he said when the bidding ended. &quot;Not bad indeed.&quot; and smiled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="/the-try-new-things-couple/">&lt;p&gt;Gwendolyn and Stefan love to try new things.
Not like... &lt;em&gt;sex things&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but like &lt;em&gt;lifestyle things&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Take, for example, Gwendolyn decided last week that she would love to see what life was like if she and Stefan only shared &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; bowl, plate, cup, fork, knife, spoon, and pan for a month.
She didn&#x27;t really have a good reason for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; at the time, it&#x27;s not like she read it in a magazine or anything, but they&#x27;re young and into wacky stuff like that.
Stefan always participates in these and likes talking about their &lt;em&gt;adventures&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as they&#x27;re happening, but never proposes ideas of his own.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwendolyn requires that people use the full &lt;em&gt;Gwendolyn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;Gwen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and has been known to &lt;strong&gt;halt&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; conversations if people don&#x27;t.
She feels was confident that she loves Stefan three times more than he loves her.
She wasn&#x27;t sure why she felt that way, or where three times came from, but it had always been her hunch.
Since she&#x27;s never been able to confirm or deny it, she has kept on believing it; this puts her in an artificially smug mood whenever she sacrifices something for Stefan, like the 5% markup on the organic foods because he prefers them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan previously refereed to her as &lt;em&gt;Gwen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; internally but forced himself to adapt after a few preventable meltdowns.
He hasn&#x27;t ever really considered how much he loves Gwendolyn, but he regularly thinks about the house they&#x27;ll buy together in a few years.
There isn&#x27;t actually a specific house they&#x27;re thinking about, but he still enjoys the fantasy; some women dream of their wedding day and Stefan dreams of his move-in day.
Year after year they&#x27;ve stayed in the same mid-town loft and will never did move into that house.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both definitely &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; each other to the extent that any twenty-somethings can love one another while still collectively managing to avoid the question of marriage.
They will eventually break-up, not because of any one event or central cause, but because people grow up and grow apart.
It&#x27;s never anybody&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s just how the wind blows.
Some people&#x27;s connections are able to persevere that inevitable break, but this connection will not.
Gwendolyn knows this and in the back of her head is already thinking about why a breakup would be best for them.
Stefan has thought about it once or twice but doesn&#x27;t really want things to change.
He likes spending his life with Gwendolyn and feels like they do share a really close bond, even if that bond is largely based on things like sharing one bowl, plate, cup, fork, knife, spoon, and pan for a month.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the &lt;em&gt;sharing-one-of-everything&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; thing is working out pretty well.
Gwendolyn hasn&#x27;t gotten any of their friends to try it but she really feels like she&#x27;s looking at food and meals in a whole new light.
Stefan thinks it&#x27;s a neat idea, but is looking forward to the end of this month.
He would never tell her that though.
He loves her too much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="/2015-09-01/">&lt;p&gt;Just like yesterday, I spent most of today enjoying some wonderful talks as well as stressing out -- I mean totally not stressing out -- about my own talk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;wtd-day-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;write the Docs Staff Picture&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Write the Docs Staff saying thanks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first talk of the day was titled &quot;Judas Priest Ate My Scrum Master&quot;, which has almost nothing to do with Judas Priest or eating or scrum masters; instead it talked about things that are well known issues and a lot of laws (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brooks%E2%80%99_law&quot;&gt;Brooks&#x27; Law&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lehman&amp;#x27;s_laws_of_software_evolution&quot;&gt;Lehmann&#x27;s Laws&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pareto_principle&quot;&gt;Pareto Principle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conway&amp;#x27;s_law&quot;&gt;Conway&#x27;s Law&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, etc) that nobody talks about that much but can be super helpful to consider when working in an industry.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second talk covered different types of user interfaces and what to consider when writing error messages, troubleshooting pages, product tours.
It was something I hadn&#x27;t considered having primarily written command line tools with pretty limited and well established interface
guidelines.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I gave a talk.
It was a talk. I&#x27;ll post a video of it once those get put up online and you can decide if it was good or bad.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talk after mine was a nice history lesson and wanted the audience to reflect on what documentations can learn from documentation practices of the past.
The TLDR on that one is that it used to suck to write technical docs even more than it sucks now.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then there were a bunch of lightning talks.
One talk from a twitter employee (there&#x27;s a fun name for them I&#x27;m sure) mentioned that gathering metrics are is important because without metrics everything you do is just guess and check.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next talk &quot;MacGyvering your docs&quot; brought up the fact that the best documentation toolchain will (should?) only help existing developers.
A better toolchain won&#x27;t attract new devs.
That was something I think a lot of projects can lose sight of.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talk after that covered a team of scientists studying clouds (water clouds not internet clouds) using computer simulations.
They wrote and documented a piece of software and they ended up publishing their program&#x27;s documentation in a scientific journal.
It&#x27;s already been sited and everything.
I hadn&#x27;t even considered that as a possibility (publishing docs as a scientific paper).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next two talks were pretty short (15 minute) talks about putting the data where the users need it and an introduction to screen-casting.
The first was good for documenting things like an API and the second was good if I ever need to make a screen-cast.
I doubt that will happen, but you never know!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last talk &quot;All roads might not lead to docs&quot; held too main takeaways for me: The quote &lt;em&gt;The Purpose of this document is ________&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;voiceandtone.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;mailchimp voice &amp;amp; tone guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is a very good document I suggest you read it (the title is pretty self explanatory I think).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a full list of talks given at the conference, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writethedocs.org&#x2F;conf&#x2F;eu&#x2F;2015&#x2F;schedule&#x2F;&quot;&gt;event&#x27;s schedule&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after party ended up happening at two venues since we got pre-maturely kicked out of the first one; we made the best of it and I got to talk to Anna Jaruga (the cloud research scientist) as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Mozilla Development Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; writer, both very interesting people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="/2015-08-31/">&lt;p&gt;I spent most of today enjoying the Write the Docs talks and (air
conditioned) venue. I took some notes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The keynote about the imposter syndrome was very relatable.
The coping mechanism of framing goals in &quot;I want to do...&quot; instead of &quot;I want to be...&quot; seems like it could be effective.
I liked the quote &quot;Make better mistakes tomorrow&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second talk about naming things was very good and got me to think about the structure of documentation metadata (using labels vs taxonomy vs thesaurus, etc).
This will be useful someday I&#x27;m sure.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third talk about [emojii] and the use of emoji was [emojii].
I never considered using them before, but I will going forward.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fourth talk mentioned using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Selenium_%28software%29?wprov=sfia1&quot;&gt;Selenium&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to test docs, that just makes sense.
It&#x27;s so obvious I wish it was easier.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API Docs talk mentioned that you should give your user the data they will be working with as a top level priority instead of an after
thought.
This will definitely be a priority for me.
I already try to give plenty of examples (since I speak example natively), but I&#x27;ll be more Conscience of it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Design Docs with Disability in Mind was interesting.
The big takeaway for me was keeping the elderly in mind.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meta talk about crafting a presentation was delivered very well and mentioned adding contrast slide decks... I should have listened to
this advice...&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second to the last talk of the day covered the plethora of rules we place on documentation.
Having just recently helped established some style guides for the OSL docs I think we did a good job of giving some leeway to the writers.
The extreme example of &#x27;Limited rules docs&#x27; (e.g., the Python Documentation) does not really work well for the reader in my experience.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final talk by some &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; writers equated docs to a garden. The metaphor worked surprisingly well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a full list of the talks and their descriptions, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writethedocs.org&#x2F;conf&#x2F;eu&#x2F;2015&#x2F;schedule&#x2F;&quot;&gt;event&#x27;s schedule&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 was pretty emojii. We ended the night with emojii at a venue called The Pub.
Many conversations and laughs were had.
I like this crowd.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writethedocs.org&#x2F;conf&#x2F;eu&#x2F;2015&#x2F;#events&quot;&gt;city tour&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Prague provided by Write The Docs.
We crossed some bridges, saw some castles, and experienced many wonderful parts of the city.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;prague-gelato.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My dumb face and a delicious gelato.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&#x27;s me in front of a church eating some gelato.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour I was very hungry and tagged along with some folks from my tour group on a journey to get food.
We went to a restaurant that brought us beer on a model train.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;prague-beer-train.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Choo choo. Here comes the beer train.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the train that brought us beer.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some picture I took of the buildings in the city.
I like the architecture a lot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;prague-city-center.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Classic architecture in the Prague city center.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;prague-street.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Even the small regular old streets in Prague are breathtaking.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are so cool.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I haven&#x27;t found the words to describe why, but the asthetics please me.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour and food there was a &lt;em&gt;Write the Docs Conference Reception&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (aka meet &amp;amp; greet) where I got to hang out with many of the attendees of the conference.
There was food and fabulous people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not have a hard time falling asleep that night.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paperweight whispers to a mathematician: &quot;I feel so depressed.&quot;
-&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MagicRealismBot&#x2F;status&#x2F;770382059319595008&quot;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrick Gustav was working well into the night as he was known to do in the weeks preceding a publication of his work.
When he worked deep into the night he took a drug called Caffeine in various forms from liquid to pill form to stay awake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the long nights he was also known to converse with furniture and inanimate objects around the room which were up for a quick chat as he needed to rest.
If his &#x27;people skills&#x27; were more astute (and there were people around to see him) Fredrick might be embarrassed by his own behavior but the pros really did outweigh the cons this late at night.
His bookshelf had many interesting things to say but could sometimes overwhelm him.
His chair was also good to talk with, but didn&#x27;t get out much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight Fredrick&#x27;s paperweight decided to speak up.
It was a small manatee Beanie Baby and it started the conversation similar to how his bottom drawer tended to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel so depressed.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrick was shocked by the plush manatee.
It had never spoken up before and quite frankly he wasn&#x27;t sure it was able to until just now.
After the shock subsided he responded.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well you&#x27;re a new voice.
What might your name be there beanie baby manatee?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBM sighed and reflected on the question but was unable to answer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you have a name?
You&#x27;ve been around this office for almost a year now, it seems about time I learned what to call you.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBM responded positively to this idea and so Fredrick began the search for a name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, it seems like &lt;em&gt;Snooty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a pretty famous manatee in Florida.
Mind if I call you that?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBM responded shyly &quot;Yeah... that sounds okay...&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrick, not picking up on the hesitation in BBM&#x27;s voice, carried on proud of his naming abilities and ready for the rest of the night.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wonderful.So my next question is &#x27;Why do you feel depressed Snooty?&#x27;&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snooty, who had not yet fully accepted the name, felt it was obvious why.
She had been stuck in this office for over a year and why?
She was bought by a mother and daughter and had &lt;em&gt;hoped&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that she would be adopted by them, but of course she ended up being taken in by an old fart like Fredrick. She couldn&#x27;t tell him that but it was how she felt.
Somehow she wanted to get out of here and into the &lt;em&gt;real world&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
She wanted to go to the park with a kid who named her something infinitely more creative than &#x27;Snooty&#x27;.
She wanted to go on adventures and see wonders of the world outside people called &lt;em&gt;Cincinnati&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Despite her fear of his reaction she quickly mustered up the gumption to tell Fredrick.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#x27;m depressed because... because I&#x27;m stuck in this office when I could be on adventures with a kid.
Adventures like... like I&#x27;m supposed to be on.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrick reflected on this for a while.
Glancing between her and the seventh draft of his publication.
He finally spoke up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I understand.
If I were you I&#x27;d want to get out of this office too.
Maybe my daughter can find a good home for you, she works with children.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snooty was very excited at this prospect and if she could physically smile she would have just then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later Fredrick called it a night, packed up his things, and went home with Snooty in his briefcase.
He arrive home at almost 2:47am and left Snooty in the keys bowl.
He felt sad sometimes, coming home late to an empty house.
Even his paper weight didn&#x27;t like him, how could expect his wife and children to do the same.
But he got up the next morning and did it all again.
At least he&#x27;d have his office to keep him company.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say I hate travel, but that level of hyperbole is literally the worst thing on the planet...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strong dislike for travel comes mostly from my personal inability to trust the systems that will get me to where I am going.
If I have a flight in one week and I have to take a bus or train to the airport, I will spend the entire week running through my head
&quot;When is my flight?
Umm days, yeesh hours, and ack minutes.
How am I getting there?
The oh God bus leaving at some time, somewhere bound.
Once you get there you will go through security which will take between 5 minutes and 2 hours.
Budget your time appropriately.
Any of these systems can fail and based on experience they have&quot;
over and over and over.
The stress is compounded when people don&#x27;t always speak your language and you forgot to eat a proper meal the morning of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is why I am 3 hours early to my flight from Amsterdam to Prague.
I regret nothing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;currency-is-weird&quot;&gt;Currency is Weird&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I went on an awesome bike ride all the way to Haarlem (15km west of Amsterdam).
I didn&#x27;t actually do anything there; I just went, picked up snacks, and headed back.
I&#x27;m 99% sure I missed out on an awesome Haarlem exclusive cultural experience, but if was really more about the journey (I originally set out to bike to the coast and Haarlem was my compromise to that).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-huge-park.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I don&amp;#39;t recall where this park is exactly. I remember i twas east of the city center, many kilometers&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-huge-park-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Another view of the park, this time with a play structure&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found a very neat park near the Western edge of Amsterdam; I ended up spending an hour or so there having a picnic.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dilapidated&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-dilapidated-building.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An old and dilapiddated building. It&amp;#39;s hard to tell the building original purpose...&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was a cool abandoned building I found.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I like abandoned buildings.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-travelers-trash-can.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A large ice-cream cone shaped trashcan at a 45 degree angle for cyclists to dispose of trash into.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also found this awesome trash can for people riding bikes.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s genius.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-ponies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ponies!&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PONIES&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bike ride I was very tired.
I slept a lot.
And yet not enough...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-and-large-appreciations&quot;&gt;Small (and Large) Appreciations&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of some of the traits of Amsterdam (and what I have experienced of the Netherlands at large) which I appreciate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have signs that tell you you&#x27;re going the wrong direction.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can bike to another city and be on bike paths the whole time!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bikes are easy to use and aren&#x27;t shoe-horned in as a second class mode of transportation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trains are so quiet. Why can&#x27;t America have quiet trains?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list will probably grow as I remember things.
All in all I like the city and the country.
You should visit if you haven&#x27;t already.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="/2015-08-27/">&lt;p&gt;TodayI visited the Van Gough museum.
I tried to get in using my mom&#x27;s Amsterdam Museum Pass, but it didn&#x27;t fly there like it did at the Rijks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty fun, but the entire experience felt very artificial and plastic.
The paintings were great to see in person, but everything around the pieces felt a little tacky.
My opinion will likely change about it, but I did not enjoy the Van Gough museum nearly as much as I enjoyed the Rijks Museum, despite my love for Van Gough and his works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day walking around and cashed in early.
Jetlag + lots of walking = ready for bed by 3pm.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-canal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A panorama of an Amsterdam canal&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#x27;m not sure which street I took this panorama on, but I think it looks awesome.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It captures the Amsterdam canal street pretty well.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went to the Rijks Museum and had a bit of a culture overload.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-milk-maid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chilling with the milk maid.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody got selfies with Van Gough, so I got a selfie The Milkmaid.
I realize in retrospect that it doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, this is my face when I realized the bathroom stalls go from floor to ceiling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-all-the-way.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Surprise and joy&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, this photo was taken in the bathroom stall.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is a classy restaurant I found with classy lamps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-cute-lamp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A lamp with a cute switch&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They were closed, otherwise I would have gone in.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-travel-tips&quot;&gt;Some Travel Tips&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have not completed my trip, I have some tips to share with you about travel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always bring a &#x27;Go Bag&#x27; when you go out for the day.
Fill it with snacks and necessities and leave plenty of room for memorabilia you get while out and about.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try something new before defaulting to your comfort zone.
This is true for food as well as experiences.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always being plenty of snacks and water.
You will regret it if you don&#x27;t.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient.
You invested a lot to get here, make it count.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a museum, take a picture of the plackard after taking a picture of the piece so you don&#x27;t forget what it&#x27;s called.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to sit in a café and just read for a bit.
Sometimes that&#x27;s as culturally diversifying as a day in a museum or city tour.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pdx-ams&quot;&gt;PDX -&amp;gt; AMS&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight was uneventful.
It was the longest one I&#x27;ve ever been on, which is always a rough milestone to overcome, but actually one of the
better flights I&#x27;ve taken.
TIL Delta&#x27;s service does not suck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually sleep the entire way to &amp;lt;insert location here&amp;gt;, but I managed to stay productive (coding, reading, writing) for the majority of flight.
I must say, it was nice to have my own personal screen to catch up on Last Week Tonight.
I&#x27;ve wanted to watch that show for ages...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Lazy bliss not pictured&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-0-part-1&quot;&gt;Day 0: Part 1&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wrote down some thoughts about Amsterdam thus far:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People keep using fake made up words. What&#x27;s up with that?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The roads are tiny but people keep driving on them.
It looks like chaos but I haven&#x27;t seen an accident yet.
I&#x27;m kinda impressed.
People aren&#x27;t even yelling at each other about almost getting hit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The toilet paper squares are actually rectangles.
It might just be the toilet paper at the place I am staying.
Either way, I can&#x27;t deal with this aspect ratio change. I might not be able to poop in Amsterdam.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trains are so quiet.
I didn&#x27;t want to get off...&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s some pictures I took:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-view.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mostly trees and sky.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from the location I am staying at.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-park-panorama.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Panorama of an amsterdam park&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A panorama from the park outside of where I am staying.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-goats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Goats!&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some goats I found.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaaaand naptime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-0-part-2&quot;&gt;Day 0: Part 2&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished today by going to the Red Light District. There were a lot of half naked ladies in windows.
They kept winking at me. I&#x27;m pretty sure they liked me; it&#x27;s not like they &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; have a monetary incentive to get my attention or anything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up finding a bar and enjoying a Belgian White Beer.
It tasted &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1534&#x2F;&quot;&gt;surprisingly good&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;europe-2015&#x2F;amsterdam-beer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A belgium white beer&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So this is what it feels like to drink in a bar... neat.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Clothing. Gameboy SP at the top.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; bag of things to bring to Europe, but certainly solid and most of it practical.
I&#x27;m packing an extra bag for all of the trinkets I&#x27;ll bring back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="/2015-08-01/">&lt;p&gt;This blog was created in preparation for my trip to Europe in about 3 weeks.
I wanted to see how difficult it would be to make a blog that could be updated on the go, version controlled with git, and would not require me to log into a laptop or server to make changes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up using PageUp (link in the footer), along with Github Gists (also linked in the footer) to make a mostly useful platform.
New changes are pushed to Github, my personal server pulls those changes every 10 minutes, and this page is rebuilt pretty painlessly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all: with a git client on my phone I can make updates anywhere that has a signal and I don&#x27;t need to bust my laptop out.
I wrote this post while I was on the toilet!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as easy as using an established platform like Twitter, but just like with everything I try to make, I put something together I would want to use and interact with.
If a friend started a liveblog for a specific event I would follow it over their Twitter feed any day.
Plus I don&#x27;t have to deal with the character limit of Twitter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
